## About the project
A small Battleship game project as a way to introduce myself into the object oriented programming.

* Python 3.6
Mac/Linux/Windows
```sh
python --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YarosThk/battleship
```

### Usage

1. Execute run.py
2. You will be promted to pick a game mode. Input 1 or 2, to play against a machine or another player respectively. 
3. Following that you will have to input a player1 and player 2 names and shipt position one by one. 
    Coordinates are as follows 1, 1 = x (horizontal), y (vertical).
4. Once all ships are set, each player will take a turn to write a shot : 1, 1 = x (horizontal), y (vertical). Output : HIT, HIT & SUNK, MISS.
5. When one of the players gets all his/hers ships sunk, the game will be over.
